### What is the Event Loop?
- The event loop is a programming construct used to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. It's a loop that continually checks if there are any pending tasks in the event queue and executes them one by one. It ensures that Node.js can handle a large number of simultaneous requests efficiently.

### Explain the 6 phases of the event loop.

- Timers: The event loop starts by checking for any pending timer callbacks that are set to run.
- Pending callbacks: If there are any pending callbacks from previous iterations of the event loop, they are executed next.
- Idle, prepare: These two phases are internal to the event loop and are not usually relevant to developers.
- Poll: This is where I/O operations are processed. If there are any pending I/O operations, they are processed in this phase.
- Check: This phase is used to execute callbacks that were scheduled by setImmediate().
- Close callbacks: Any close callbacks, such  are executed last.

### List some best practices in server-side code development.

- Using a consistent code style throughout the project.
- Using a modular approach to code organization.
- Implementing error handling to avoid server crashes and improve debugging.
- Using logging to keep track of server activity and errors.
- Optimizing code for performance, including database queries, caching, and network requests.
- Use security best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
- Test thoroughly, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### What is NPM5. How do you initialize a package in npm?
NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js. It's used to manage dependencies and packages for Node.js applications.

### Initialize a package if your choice, give it a name and install the following npm packages to it, express, mongoose, joi.
